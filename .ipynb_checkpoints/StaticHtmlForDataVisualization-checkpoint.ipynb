    "# Using Static HTML to Visualize Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Static HTML is a very convenient way to easily visualize data and results. It provides a low-tech way to produce clean, organized, well-formated displays and requires almost no overhead. Given the large number of data visualizaton libraries that are available, it is often overlooked, but can still be a very powerful tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of what I consider to be the most obvious benefits:\n",
    "* There are no library dependancies and the outputs can be visualized on any platform/OS. Can't get the shiny data visualization toolbox installed? No problem. All you need is a web browser and you are set. \n",
    "* Easily implemented in any software language and given that the output is an ASCII file it is typically very easy to debug. \n",
    "* Easily extended and customized using more advanced HTML or CSS. You can get as fancy as you want. If you are willing to invest some upfront time into creating some helper functions then you can make really nice visualization products with minimal effort. "
